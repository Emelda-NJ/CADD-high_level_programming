"""
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y	
%	Modulus	x % y	
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	
//	Floor division	x // y
"""

#/ performs standard division, resulting in a floating-point number, while // performs floor division, returning the largest whole number less than or equal to the result.

"""
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
==	Equal	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

"""
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)
