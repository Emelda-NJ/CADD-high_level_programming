Python Programming Basics

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

KEY CONCEPTS

Value (data types)
* String:
Text value
* Int:
Number value (no decimal places)
* Float:
Number value (has decimal places)
* Boolean:
True or false value

Variable
- Used to store values
- Has a unique name that you choose

Operator
- Used for assigning a value to a variable
- Used for math between two values or variables

Function
- Pre-written code that can be used repeatedly

Print
- Function that displays a string in the console

Error
- Text displayed in the console when Python detects a mistake
- Shows the location (line number) of the mistake

Statement
- A single line of code that does something
- Like a sentence, every statement has a subject and a verb

Comment
- Not interpreted by Python
- Used to explain what the code does

Console
- Where you see the programâ€™s output (print results and errors)

SYNTAX

Values
- Use quotation marks (" or ') around a string
- Use decimal points (.) to turn an int into a float
- Booleans can only be True or False

Functions
- Use parentheses (()) after the name to use a function
- Add the parameter between the parentheses if needed (like in print)

Comments
- Use an octothorpe (#) to start a single-line comment
- Use triple quotes (""") around a multi-line comment

Some common operators
   
     A = B
Set variable A to the value of B
     
     A + B
Add A and B
     
     A - B
Subtract B from A
     
     A * B
Multiply A by B
     
     A / B
Divide A by B
